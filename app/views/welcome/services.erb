			<p><%= FIRM_TITLE %> has several testing solutions. Either we, or a contractor of your choice can give you price quotes for the solution that fits your needs.</p> 

			<p>On the day of your appointment, we will dig a 3 &ndash; 4 foot hole in your yard in order to access your service line. We then take measurements and samples of your line and analyze for lead content. We'll also access the pipes in your home, typically in the basement, to draw samples.</p>

			<p>After we have collected samples, we will fill in the hole and replace or re-seed your lawn. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to go over our findings.</p>

			<p>Once we have analyzed the composition of your service line, home pipes, and solder joints, we will get back to you with recommendations. If we find lead, usually the easiest solution is to run a new flexible water line to some or all of your sinks. In most cases this is done from the basement without any wall damage or repairs.</p>
