		<p><%= FIRM_TITLE %> has several testing solutions. On the day of your appointment, we begin with a review of the the possible ways lead could get into the drinking water of your home, based on the specific traits of your house and property.</p> 

		<p>The cost to establish a total picture of the lead hazard on your property usually ranges from $200 to $1,600, depending on the variety of tests we need to administer.</p>

		<p>After we have completed all the tests, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to go over our findings, providing you with documentation of the specific results. We will explain the implications of the test results in plain English.</p>

		<p>Once you have a total picture of the situation on your property, we will offer advice on how best to replace any fixtures that are a lead hazard. We are always happy to work with our clients' preferred plumber, or to provide all replacement services that may be needed on an Ã  la carte basis.</p>
